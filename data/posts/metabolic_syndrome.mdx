# METABOLIC SYNDROME AND ITS DISCONTENTS

### THE DEADLY COMBO

There is a deadly interconnected combination of conditions that seriously compromise the quality of life. One in three Indians have it. Women are more susceptible to it than Men, and it worsens as we age.

Metabolic Syndrome is its name, insulin, cholesterol, and triglycerides are the players in this game. Let us understand what it is, and what it causes, and in the next post, let's look at what can be done, to manage, delay, and if possible, altogether avoid this harmful cocktail.

### SOME METRICS

If you have three or more of the following risk factors, then please be concerned:

1. A waist measurement of 40 inches or more for men and 35 inches or more for women

2. A fasting triglyceride level of 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or higher

3. An HDL level of less than 40 mg/dL for men and less than 50 mg/dL for women

4. A systolic blood pressure of 130 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher or a diastolic blood pressure of 85 mm Hg or higher

5. A fasting blood sugar level of 100 mg/dL or higher

### METABOLISM

Our bodies are a bewildering site of complexity to behold! Every cell is constantly in flux. The cell, the fundamental unit of the biological world can be thought of as a stage where diverse processes dance to the tune of life to keep us alive. The total of every moving part of this dance in scientific terms is termed metabolism: The set of all chemical reactions necessary to sustain life.

This process can be broadly classified into

### Catabolism

The breakdown of marcomolecules such as Carbohydrates, Lipids, Protein, and nucleic acids to release energy to maintain various
processes in our body.

### Anabolism

The build-up of marcomolecules mentioned above from smaller units such as nutrients, cells, and amino acids. An example is **DNA replication**. Our bodies are constantly making new DNA.

It's responsible for growing new cells, healing wounds, and building muscle. In our childhood years, our anabolism is higher than catabolism. In a future post, we shall explore how to measure biomarkers that measure each of these aspects of our metabolism.

Let us have a simple look at how INSULIN plays a central role in metabolic syndrome.

It is not an overstatement to say that Insulin resistance is the seed that leads to the poisonous tree called metabolic syndrome.

### INSULIN: What is it?

#### It's a hormone

If you google "What is Insulin" you get the answer, it's a hormone. Okay,
so what's a hormone?

#### What's a hormone?

Well, hormone are chemicals, that perform certain
functions in our body.

#### Hormones are like messengers

The job of a hormone is to carry messages through your bloodstream to
organs, tissues, skin, and even muscles.

The system that does this, is called the [Endocrine system](https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/overview-endocrine-system#:~:text=Hormones%20act%20as%20chemical%20messengers,in%20humans%20and%20other%20verterbrates)

Skeletal muscle has recently been identified as an organ that produces
certain proteins called cytokines. This is an incredibly exciting topic that
will be covered later. Back to Insulin for now.

### Insulin, What does it do?

Insulin helps convert food in your body to energy and regulates your blood sugar levels.

It is produced in the pancreas and utilizing sugar for energy is its job.
The inability of your pancreas to
produce enough insulin to process glucose in your body leads
to Type 2 diabetes.

Insulin takes the glucose our bodies produce and transports it into the various cells in our body.
Thus, a lack of insulin production leads to excess glucose
being built up in our bloodstream.

### Connecting Insulin resistance (IR) to Metabolic Syndrome (MS)

However, a causal link between IR and MS has not been established. One may think of it as follows:

The body stores an excess level of glucose in the bloodstream as follows:

1. Glycogen in skeletal muscles and the liver.

2. As fat which can later be used for energy.

This excess storage of fat due to import insulin response can lead to:

1. Type 2 diabetes

2. High blood pressure

3. Obesity

4. High triglyceride levels

As you can see, IR plants quite an evil seed.

In the next post, we shall have a look at various lifestyle measures one can take to keep
Your metabolic health is in check.
